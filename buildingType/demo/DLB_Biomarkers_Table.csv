ID,Biomarker Name,Type,Detection Method,Clinical Relevance,Comment
1,Dopamine Transporter (DAT),Imaging,SPECT (¹²³I-FP-CIT / DaTSCAN),Helps confirm dopaminergic deficit typical of DLB,Reduced striatal uptake indicates loss of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons
2,Cardiac MIBG Uptake,Imaging,SPECT (¹²³I-MIBG),Differentiates DLB from Alzheimer’s disease,Reduced cardiac sympathetic innervation is common in DLB but preserved in AD
3,Glucose Metabolism,Imaging,PET (FDG),Supports DLB diagnosis via characteristic metabolic patterns,Occipital hypometabolism and “cingulate island sign” are typical in DLB
4,CSF α-synuclein,Fluid biomarker,Lumbar puncture,May reflect Lewy body pathology,Elevated or misfolded α-synuclein correlates with Lewy body burden
5,CSF Tau / Aβ,Fluid biomarker,Lumbar puncture,Helps rule out or confirm co-existing Alzheimer’s pathology,DLB often shows lower tau and variable Aβ42 compared to AD
6,RT-QuIC α-synuclein,Fluid biomarker,CSF assay,High specificity for Lewy body disorders,Detects misfolded α-synuclein via amplification; promising for early diagnosis
7,Structural MRI,Imaging,MRI,Supports differential diagnosis,May show insular or occipital atrophy; less hippocampal atrophy than AD
8,Plasma Neurodegeneration Markers,Fluid biomarker,Blood test,Emerging tools for tracking disease progression,Includes neurofilament light chain and p-Tau217; may reflect neuronal damage
